# DB-Market
This project was part of my Databases class and it is a simple demonstration of a SQL database accessed via a website.

The database is supposed to belong to a super market chain, named 'DB Market'.
You can see the complete structure in the ER diagram.

The Database was made with MySQL and ran in a MySQL server. The website code was written from scratch in HTML and Javascript, while Apache Tomcat was the server of our choice.

You can find the Database part of the project in the SQL dump file, while the website part of the project is in the folder named UI.
